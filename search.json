      "contents": "\nData and Preprocessing\nWe use data from a database listing the University of Basel’s research output between 2000 and 2020. There are a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nIn addition, we use data from the Equal opportunities monitoring concerning the percentage of females in different positions (i.e., professorships, academic staff) available for the period 2013-2019.\nDiversity Dimensions\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names.\nWe recruit the services genderize.io, agify.io, nationalize.io to determine the authors’ probable gender, age, and nation, respectively. Estimates are provided based on the services’ databases that include hundreds of thousands of confirmed mappings on the internet between first names and these three characteristics. In addition to probable categories, the services return information on confidence. For instance, for the name Alexandra, agify.io informs that 98% of 122’985 gender records point to a female gender, that the probable age is 27 based on 114,238 age records, and that there is a 11.7% probability that the nation is Romania, a 5.1% probability that the nation is Ecuador, and a 4.5% probability that the nation is Portugal.\nYou can use the links above to try out the three services for yourself.\n\n\n\nWe have processed the data in the following way to simplify our analysis. For gender and age, we only use the probable value, irrespective of the number of instances or the assigned probability. For nation, we determine whether any of the three most probable nations include a “western” nation defined as geographic Europe, the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Additional checking of names suggested that this categorization of nationality is suboptimal and we refrain to present results concerning this dimension in our report.\nOrganizational Units\nIn a previous project, CDS members identified faculty-level organizational units within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) manually, using the descriptors in use at the University of Basel in 2021.\nThe data is shared via this Github repository.\nVariables\nVariable\nDescription\nauthor\nList of authors.\nyear\nYear of publication.\ntitle\nTitle of publication.\norganization\nOriginal list of Unibas organizations involved in publication.\nunibas\nPublication offically affiliated with University of Basel.\ncategory\nCategory of publication: Journal, Chapter, Book, Thesis, Proceedings, Other.\nn_authors\nNumber of authors\ngender_proportion\nProportion of female authors.\ngender_first\nIs first author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_middle\nProportion of female authors excluding first and last author, where available.\ngender_last\nIs last author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_diversity\nmeasure of gender dispersion\nage_average\nAverage age of authors.\nage_first\nAge of first author.\nage_middle\nAverage age of authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nage_last\nAge of last author.\nage_diversity\nmeasure of age dispersion\nnation_proportion\nProportion of western authors.\nnation_first\nIs first author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_middle\nProportion of western authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nnation_last\nIs last author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_diversity\nmeasure of nationality dispersion\nOrg-*\nLogical vectors indicating Unibas faculty-level organizations involved in publication.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nExecutive Summary\nMonitoring of diversity is an important first step towards reducing inequalities in access to scientific innovation and research. We contribute to monitoring of author diversity in scientific production at the University of Basel by conducting an analysis of gender distribution in scientific publications. We analysed the diversity of the University of Basel’s research output by categorizing authors’ gender based on authors’ first names and visualizing temporal trends between 2000 and 2020 in gender distribution for all 7 faculties of the University of Basel. Our results for the University of Basel match similar reports of gender publication gaps in the sciences. Crucially, we find large differences across faculties and author positions (first vs. last) suggesting that targeted measures may be needed for different organizational units and career stages. We discuss implications for future efforts to monitoring diversity in scientific production and associated interventions at the University of Basel and beyond.\nBackground\nWhy does diversity matter?\nAchieving gender equality (SDG 5) and reducing inequalities (SDG10) are central parts of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Universities can play a key role in advancing these goals by empowering women and disadvantaged minorities to allow them to make contributions to scientific innovation and research. The University of Basel is strongly committed to monitoring and increasing diversity of its staff and student population in a number of efforts spearheaded by its Diversity Office.\nWhy does monitoring of research outputs matter?\nMonitoring diversity is a first step towards identifying inequalities and potential solutions to reduce them. As a consequence, there have been continued efforts on the part of the Diversity Office of the University of Basel to monitor diversity, for example, in the form of an Equal opportunities monitoring. However, the current monitoring does not fully capture all aspects of equal opportunities to scientific production. The monitoring of publication outputs can be helpful as an additional indicator because it has the potential to reflect access to resources (e.g., time, internal funding) that go beyond employment and are otherwise not easily quantifiable.\nGoals of this Report\nvisualize the gender diversity in research outputs at the University Basel;\nprovide ideas for future monitoring of diversity at the University of Basel, including future methodological approaches or data collection efforts;\ndiscuss whether the monitoring of research outputs can help guide future interventions aimed at increasing diversity at the University of Basel.\nMethods\nResearch Output of the University of Basel\nWe use data from a database listing the University of Basel’s research output. We focus on data between 2000 and 2020 because availability for earlier years is limited and this time range allows some comparability to previous efforts (e.g., Odic & Wojcik, 2019). We focus our analyses on University of Basel’s 7 faculties and neglect smaller associated institutes because there is a relatively large number of institutes with relatively few publications that make it difficult to consider trends over time.\nWe analyze a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nEmployment Information of the University of Basel\nWe use data from the Equal opportunities monitoring concerning the percentage of females in different positions (i.e., professorships, academic staff) available for the period 2013-2019.\nDiversity Labeling from Author First Names\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names. We recruited existing publicly available services (e.g., genderize.io) to determine each author’s individual characteristics, such as gender. Estimates are provided based on the services’ databases that include hundreds of thousands of confirmed mappings between first names and individuals’ characteristics. The figure below shows the most frequent male (left) and female (right) names as identified by genderize.io. Additional details are provided on the Data page.\n\nOur report focuses on gender in line with the majority of past monitoring of diversity at the University of Basel and other similar efforts. Ideally, however, diversity should be conceptualized through several dimensions, that could include cultural and socio-economic background, political views, age, nationality, or religion, to name but a few. In our efforts, we strove to include different dimensions beyond gender, namely, nationality and age. Our simple validation efforts suggested, however, that such categorizations are unreliable so we refrain from reporting results concerning these dimensions below. We discuss limitations of our approach and alternative methods in the Limitations and Outlook sections.\nDisclaimer\nOur analyses used first names to estimate the gender of authors using extant technology. This classification system assigns names to either “female” or “male”, thus, providing a traditional, binary classification of gender. The contributors would like to state that this choice is of technical and pragmatic nature and should not be understood as a rejection of more inclusive, non-binary gender definitions.\n\n\n\nThe Publication Gender Gap at the University of Basel\nPast work has show a publication gender gap in the sciences (e.g., Huang, Gates, Sinatra, & Barabási, 2020; Ni, Smith, Yuan, Larivière, & Sugimoto, 2021; Odic & Wojcik, 2020). In what follows, we assess the publication gender gap at the University of Basel based on all outputs available in the university’s research database. The figure below shows the publication gap over time separately for each of the 7 faculties of the University of Basel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows evidence of a publication gender gap at the University of Basel. Across all faculties and time, the predominance of the dark blue color indicates there were overall more publications involving males (69%) relative to females (31%). Notwithstanding, the figure suggests a general upward trend in the percentage of publications involving females over the last two decades, while in 2000 the percentage of female authors was 21%, in 2020 this percentage was 35%.\nThe overall levels as well as temporal trends vary, however, markedly between faculties: some faculties show a greater percentage of publications involving females across the full 20-year period (2000-2020), most notably the Faculty of Psychology (38%), the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (35%), and the Faculty of Law (35%). Concerning temporal trends, some faculties have seen a greater increase, most notably the Faculty of Psychology, which saw an increase of 26% from 2000 to 2020. The following table shows the total number of publications, the overal percentage of publications involving females, as well as a breakdown for 2000 vs. 2020, along with the difference between the two.\n\nFaculty\nPubs\nTotal % Female\n2000 % Female\n2020 % Female\nDiff %\nBusiness & Economics\n1692\n10\n2\n19\n17\nHumanities & Social Sciences\n16585\n35\n25\n42\n17\nLaw\n5743\n35\n28\n35\n6\nMedicine\n12811\n28\n15\n35\n20\nNatural Sciences\n17032\n25\n16\n27\n12\nPsychology\n3100\n38\n22\n49\n26\nTheology\n1762\n27\n38\n20\n-18\n\nLinking the Publication and Employment Gender Gaps: The Role of Seniority\nFirst authorship is typically (but not always) associated with junior academic roles in publications involving multiple authors, while last authorship typically cues seniority. Consequently, distinguishing between first and last authorship can allow us to consider trends in the publication gender gap as a function of seniority (i.e., career stage). When considering these analysis and, particularly, comparing between faculties, it should be noted that determination of authorship order follows different practices across fields (e.g., alphabetical order in economics). Below, we show the breakdown of the publication gap by first vs. last author for publications involving multiple authors (upper panel) along with the percentage employment of females in professorships vs. academic staff (lower panel). Please note that we only present employment data for the 2013-2019 period (available from the Equal Opportunities Monitoring) and extrapolate the temporal pattern for the full 2000-2020 period using a statistical model (linear regression).\n\n\n\nAs can be seen in the upper panel, there is a general trend for larger proportion of females in first vs. last authors; this pattern matches the larger prevalence of females in junior (academic staff) vs. senior (professorships) roles that is evident in the lower panel.\nAs presented in the previous section concerning the overall percentage of females, the temporal trends split by first vs. last author show similar increases over time, and, again, patterns differ somewhat betwen faculties. Crucially, the temporal trends observed are not always parallel for first and last authors suggesting that the dynamics underlying academic productivity can differ somewhat for the different career stages, at least for some faculties (cf. Natural Sciences, Psychology, Theology).\nKey Findings and Implications\nWe identified a persistent and sizable publication gender gap at the University of Basel in the 2000 to 2020 period. This goes beyond the current monitoring of equal opportunities at the University of Basel which focuses mostly on employment (and gender representation in different universitary committees) but does not consider research output.\nOur results show that the publication gender gap has decreased over the last 20 years, albeit at different rates across the 7 faculties that compose the University of Basel.\nThe publication gender gap is larger and more persistent for last (i.e., senior) authors for some faculties, suggesting that different dynamics are at play for different career stages for some organizational units of the University of Basel.\nLimitations\nThere are a number of limitations associated with the results we present above, we list and discuss a few of these below.\nThe number of publications per faculty and year are limited and relatively small for some organizational units (e.g., Theology) which makes difficult to assess trends over time, particularly when distinguishing between authors roles.\nWe use faculty as organizational unit but some faculties are composed of an htereogenous number of departments covering different academic fields that may differ from each other in several respects (e.g., Faculty of Sciences). Future work could conduct more specific analysis per department or academic field, albeit smaller number of publications per organizational unit may present a limiting factor for such analyses.\nWe cannot guarantee that the research database we relied upoon provides full and equal coverage of all researchers of the University of Basel. Future work could include the use of additional databases (e.g., Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science) to assess the current coverage of the research database we used.\nWe used authorship order (i.e., first vs. last author) as a proxy for seniority, however, this practice is deferentially prevalent across fields and time. Using admistrative data could be helpful in assessing the role of seniority on academic productivity and the publication gap at the University of Basel.\nOur report identifies a gender publication gap but does not address potential underlying causes beyond differences in employment. Additional work could involve using additional monitoring (see Outlook) or adopting other approaches such as interviews or targeted questionnaires involving specific groups of researchers to investigate the underlying causes leading to a publication gap.\nWe should point out that the gender categorization used in our analyzes may function as a proxy for other individual characteristics or personal situations that correlate but are not equivalent to gender. For example, past research suggest that female academics spend more time caring for children and other family members, so gender may capture effects due to family responsibilities rather than gender per se (see also Outlook).\nFinally, we analyzed only one dimension of diversity: Gender. The use of similar approaches using other services that categorize other individual characteristics could, however, be used in the future to complement the diversity monitoring of the University of Basel, for example, regarding country of origin or ethnicity (e.g., https://www.namsor.com.\nOutlook\nTo the extent that factors leading to the employment gap are the same or correlated with the factors leading to publication success, one can expect the publication gap to be of the same or greater magnitude than the employment gap.\nPast work suggests that females are more likely to dedicate more time to teaching, have more family responsibilities, and receive less funding and recognition, each of these contributing to a widening of the gender publication gap over time relative to the extant employment gap. Monitoring the publication gap and, ideally, its underlying causes - particularly the available institutional resources - could be an important contribution of higher-education institutions to advancing equal opportunities in science and innovation. The flow diagram above lists some factors derived from the existing literature on the employment and publication gaps (e.g.Huang et al., 2020; Ni et al. 2021, Odic & Woicik, 2020) that may contribute to a widening gap between employment and publication.\n\nThere are a few recommendations that result from the results above.\nThe University of Basel could expand its monitoring to include inequalities in research productivity and factors associated with such inequalities, most centrally monitoring of internal funding (startup, support staff).\nThe University of Basel could be interested in linking academic productivity with individual characteristics that may or may not be currently available for analysis (e.g., family status, childcare). There are several challenges associated with this approach, including issues of privacy and equity but analyses of the nature we present above using such variable promise to provide more informed decisions concerning the role of personal characteristics that may or may not be amenable to intervention by higher-education institutions, such as the University of Basel.\nReferences\nHuang, J., Gates, A.
