      "contents": "\nData and Preprocessing\nWe use data from a database listing the University of Basel’s research output between 2000 and 2020. There are a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nDiversity Dimensions\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names.\nWe recruit the services genderize.io, agify.io, nationalize.io to determine the authors’ probable gender, age, and nation, respectively. Estimates are provided based on the services’ databases that include hundreds of thousands of confirmed mappings on the internet between first names and these three characteristics. In addition to probable categories, the services return information on confidence. For instance, for the name Alexandra, agify.io informs that 98% of 122’985 gender records point to a female gender, that the probable age is 27 based on 114,238 age records, and that there is a 11.7% probability that the nation is Romania, a 5.1% probability that the nation is Ecudor, and a 4.5% probability that the nation is Portugal.\nYou can use the links above to try out the three services for yourself.\n\n\n\nWe have processed the data in the following way to simplify our analysis. For gender and age, we only use the probable value, irrespective of the number of instances or the assigned probability. For nation, we determine whether any of the three most probable nations include a “western” nation defined as geographic Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia.\nOrganizational Units\nIn a previous project, CDS members identified faculty-level organizational units within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) manually, using the descriptors in use at the University of Basel in 2021.\nThe data is shared via this Github repository.\nVariables\nVariable\nDescription\nauthor\nList of authors.\nyear\nYear of publication.\ntitle\nTitle of publication.\norganization\nOriginal list of Unibas organizations involved in publication.\nunibas\nPublication offically affiliated with University of Basel.\ncategory\nCategory of publication: Journal, Chapter, Book, Thesis, Proceedings, Other.\nn_authors\nNumber of authors\ngender_proportion\nProportion of female authors.\ngender_first\nIs first author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_middle\nProportion of female authors excluding first and last author, where available.\ngender_last\nIs last author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_diversity\nmeasure of gender dispersion\nage_average\nAverage age of authors.\nage_first\nAge of first author.\nage_middle\nAverage age of authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nage_last\nAge of last author.\nage_diversity\nmeasure of age dispersion\nnation_proportion\nProportion of western authors.\nnation_first\nIs first author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_middle\nProportion of western authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nnation_last\nIs last author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_diversity\nmeasure of nationality dispersion\nOrg-*\nLogical vectors indicating Unibas faculty-level organizations involved in publication.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nSetup\nThe Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CDS) coordinates collaborative projects involving CDS members and MSc students associated with the center as part of its mission to provide training in data analytics (see cds.unibas.ch for more information).\nDr. Dirk Wulff and Prof. Dr. Rui Mata supervised the project and Dr. Dirk Wulff conducted all data preprocessing. The complete list of contributors can be found in the Contributors page. The project consists of a series of planning sessions and two collaborative hackathons described below. Resources related to the hackathons are available on this Github repository.\nHackathons\nPart I - Data Visualization (October 14th, 2021)\nGoal\nThe goal of the first hackathon session is to produce different visualizations illustrating…\nthree diversity gaps (i.e., gender, age, nationality) in number of publications over time (2000-2020);\nthe role of moderators on the different diversity gaps, such as the role of…\norganizational units\nauthorship type (e.g., single, first, last)\npublication type (e.g., journal articles, books, conference proceedings)\nRules\nEach group creates and works in a single R script that is given a unique name by the group, e.g., a group pseudonym (to avoid conflicts with the other groups’ script files). The script file is stored in 1_code. See code template including the placeholder GROUPPSEUDONYM.\nEach group creates a .pdf file containing the figure per visualization in the 2_figures folder. Figure files also must receive a suffix identifying the group. See example figure.\nPull before you Push.\nPart II - Reporting (October 20th, 2021)\nGoal\nThe goal of the second hackathon part is to produce a report based on the visualizations produced in the first hackathon using R Markdown.\nRules\nEach group creates and works in a single R Markdown document that is given a unique name by the group.\nPull before you Push.\n\n\n\n",

Put differently, the nationality pattern over time is comparable for first and last authors, and this is the case for each of the seven faculties. The patterns we see for Faculty of Theology may be confounded by the small number of publications on which the classification of authors’ nationality was based.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Outlook\nConclusion\nReferences\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nExecutive Summary\nMonitoring of diversity is an important first step towards reducing inequalities in access to scientific innovation and research. We contribute to monitoring of author diversity in scientific production at the University of Basel by conducting an analysis of gender distribution in scientific publications. We analysed the diversity of the University of Basel’s research output by categorizing authors’ gender based on authors’ first names and visualizing temporal trends between 2000 and 2020 in gender distribution for all 7 faculties of the University of Basel. Our results for the University of Basel match similar reports of gender publication gaps in the sciences. Crucially, we find large differences across faculties and author positions (first vs. last) suggesting that targeted measures may be needed for different organizational units and career stages. We discuss implications for future efforts to monitoring diversity in scientific production and associated interventions at the University of Basel and beyond.\nBackground\nWhy does diversity matter?\nAchieving gender equality (SDG 5) and reducing inequalities (SDG10) are central parts of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Universities can play a key role in advancing these goals by empowering women and disadvantaged minorities to allow them to make contributions to scientific innovation and research. The University of Basel is strongly committed to monitoring and increasing diversity of its staff and student population in a number of efforts spearheaded by its Diversity Office.\nWhy does monitoring of research outputs matter?\nMonitoring diversity is a first step towards identifying inequalities and potential solutions to reduce them. As a consequence, there have been continued efforts on the part of the Diversity Office of the University of Basel to monitor diversity, for example, in the form of an Equal opportunities monitoring. However, the current monitoring does not fully capture all aspects of equal opportunities to scientific production. The monitoring of publication outputs can be helpful as an additional indicator because it has the potential to reflect access to resources (e.g., time, internal funding) that go beyond employment and are otherwise not easily quantifiable.\nGoals of this Report\nvisualize the gender diversity in research outputs at the University Basel\nprovide ideas for future monitoring of diversity at the University of Basel, including future methodological approaches or data collection efforts\ndiscuss whether the monitoring of research outputs can help guide future interventions aimed at increasing diversity at the University of Basel\nMethods\nResearch Output of the University of Basel\nWe use data from a database listing the University of Basel’s research output. We focus on data between 2000 and 2020 because availability for earlier years is very limited and this time range allows some comparability to previous efforts (e.g., Odic & Wojcik, 2019). We focus our analyses on University of Basel’s 7 faculties and neglect smaller associated institutes because there is large number of the latter with relatively few publications that make it difficult to consider trends over time.\nWe analyze a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nDiversity Labeling from Author First Names\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names. We recruited existing publicly available services (e.g., genderize.io) to determine each author’s individual characteristics, such as gender. Estimates are provided based on the services’ databases that include hundreds of thousands of confirmed mappings between first names and individuals’ characteristics. Additional details are provided on the Data page.\nOur report focuses on gender in line with the majority of past monitoring of diversity at the University of Basel and other similar efforts. Ideally, however, diversity should be conceptualized through several dimensions, that could include cultural and socio-economic background, political views, age, nationality, or religion, to name but a few. In our efforts, we strove to include different dimensions beyond gender, namely, nationality and age. Our simple validation efforts suggested, however, that such categorizations are unreliable so we refrain from reporting results concerning these dimensions below. We discuss limitations of our approach and alternative methods in the Limitations and Outlook section.\nDisclaimer\nOur analyses used first names to estimate the gender of authors using extant technology. This classification system assigns names to either “female” or “male”, thus, providing a traditional, binary classification of gender. We would like to state that this choice is of technical nature and should not be understood as a rejection of more inclusive, non-binary gender definitions.\nThe Gender Publication Gap at the University of Basel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the publications at the University of Basel over the last 20 years, in some faculties a greater percentage of authors are females in publications ranging from the Humanities and Social Sciences (39.45%) to Business and Economics (10.69%).\nThere has been an general upward trend in the proportion of female authors from the University of Basel over the last two decades who have published. While in 2000 23.07% of authors were female, this share has increased to 31.44% in 2020.\nFor some faculties this increase was more noticeable. For instance in the Faculty of Psychology the increase of percentage points between 2000 to 2020 was highest with 27.57%, while the Faculty of Law had the lowest increase between 2000 to 2020 with a difference of 6.86%. Publication data for the Faculty of Theology allows for less confident statements but suggests a decrease in the proportion of female authors.\nIn addition to the general author proportions, we investigated authorship positions by looking at first and last authors’ gender. There is a general trend for higher female proportions in first authors than last authors. When comparing between faculties, it should be noted however, that authorship position assignment may follow different practices in different fields.\nKey findings\nIn the last 20 years, considerably more than half of the authors in the publications invesitgated irrespective of faculties, are male.\nThis gender gap in publications has decreased for most faculties over the last 20 years.\nGenerally, in the publications looked at, proportion of women among first authors was higher than among last authors.\nLimitations and Outlook\nTo be included after group discussion and input from Diversity Office (Oct 26th, 2021).\nReferences\nOdic, D., & Wojcik, E.
