There are a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nDiversity Dimensions\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names.\nWe recruit the services genderize.io, agify.io, nationalize.io to determine the authors’ probable gender, age, and nation, respectively. Estimates are provided based on the services’ databases that include hundreds of thousands of confirmed mappings on the internet between first names and these three characteristics. In addition to probable categories, the services return information on confidence. For instance, for the name Alexandra, agify.io informs that 98% of 122’985 gender records point to a female gender, that the probable age is 27 based on 114,238 age records, and that there is a 11.7% probability that the nation is Romania, a 5.1% probability that the nation is Ecudor, and a 4.5% probability that the nation is Portugal.\nYou can use the links above to try out the three services for yourself.\n\n\n\nWe have processed the data in the following way to simplify our analysis. For gender and age, we only use the probable value, irrespective of the number of instances or the assigned probability. For nation, we determine whether any of the three most probable nations include a “western” nation defined as geographic Europe, the US, Canada, and Australia.\nOrganizational Units\nIn a previous project, CDS members identified faculty-level organizational units within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) manually, using the descriptors in use at the University of Basel in 2021.\nThe data is shared via this Github repository.\nVariables\nVariable\nDescription\nauthor\nList of authors.\nyear\nYear of publication.\ntitle\nTitle of publication.\norganization\nOriginal list of Unibas organizations involved in publication.\nunibas\nPublication offically affiliated with University of Basel.\ncategory\nCategory of publication: Journal, Chapter, Book, Thesis, Proceedings, Other.\nn_authors\nNumber of authors\ngender_proportion\nProportion of female authors.\ngender_first\nIs first author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_middle\nProportion of female authors excluding first and last author, where available.\ngender_last\nIs last author female: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\ngender_diversity\nmeasure of gender dispersion\nage_average\nAverage age of authors.\nage_first\nAge of first author.\nage_middle\nAverage age of authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nage_last\nAge of last author.\nage_diversity\nmeasure of age dispersion\nnation_proportion\nProportion of western authors.\nnation_first\nIs first author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_middle\nProportion of western authors excluding first and last author, where available.\nnation_last\nIs last author western: 1 = yes, 0 = no.\nnation_diversity\nmeasure of nationality dispersion\nOrg-*\nLogical vectors indicating Unibas faculty-level organizations involved in publication.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nSetup\nThe Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CDS) coordinates collaborative projects involving CDS members and MSc students associated with the center as part of its mission to provide training in data analytics (see cds.unibas.ch for more information).\nDr. Dirk Wulff and Prof. Dr. Rui Mata supervised the project and Dr. Dirk Wulff conducted all data preprocessing. The project consists of a series of planning sessions and two collaborative hackathons described below. Resources related to the hackathons are available on this Github repository.\nHackathons\nPart I - Data Visualization (October 14th, 2021)\nGoal\nThe goal of the first hackathon session is to produce different visualizations illustrating…\nthree diversity gaps (i.e., gender, age, nationality) in number of publications over time (2000-2020);\nthe role of moderators on the different diversity gaps, such as the role of…\norganizational units\nauthorship type (e.g., single, first, last)\npublication type (e.g., journal articles, books, conference proceedings)\nRules\nEach group creates and works in a single R script that is given a unique name by the group, e.g., a group pseudonym (to avoid conflicts with the other groups’ script files). The script file is stored in 1_code. See code template including the placeholder GROUPPSEUDONYM.\nEach group creates a .pdf file containing the figure per visualization in the 2_figures folder. Figure files also must receive a suffix identifying the group. See example figure.\nPull before you Push.\nPart II - Reporting (October 20th, 2021)\nGoal\nThe goal of the second hackathon part is to produce a report based on the visualizations produced in the first hackathon using R Markdown.\nRules\nEach group creates and works in a single R Markdown document that is given a unique name by the group.\nPull before you Push.\n\n\n\n",

You can find information about the hackathon component and the associated data in the respective pages. We will make our results available in an online report in November 2021.\n\nPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n",

Universities can play a key role in advancing these goals by empowering women and disadvantaged minorities to allow them to make contributions to scientific innovation and research. The University of Basel is strongly committed to monitoring and increasing diversity of its staff and student population in a number of efforts spearheaded by its Diversity Office.\nWhy does monitoring of research outputs matter?\nMonitoring diversity is a first step towards identifying inequalities and potential solutions to reduce them. As a consequence, there have been continued efforts on the part of the Diversity Office of the University of Basel to monitor diversity, for example, in the form of an Equal opportunities monitoring. However, the current monitoring focuses on gender gap in employment and does not fully capture other aspects of equal opportunities. The monitoring of publication outputs can be helpful as an additional indicator that can better reflect access to funding or other resources (e.g., time) that are otherwise not easily quantifiable.\nIn addition, current monitoring focuses on gender but diversity should, ideally, be capture through several dimensions. The tools of data science, such as the ones we use here, may offer complementary approaches to capturing different dimensions of diversity, such as nationality or age that are not readily available for monitoring by the Diversity Office due to data privacy issues (gender, nationality).\nOur goals\nmake diversity in research outputs at University Basel visible\nprovide ideas for future monitoring, including informing decisions about future methodological approaches or data collection efforts\ndiscuss whether the monitoring of research outputs can help guide future interventions\nMethods\nResearch Output of the University of Basel 2000-2020\nWe use data from a database listing the University of Basel’s research output between 2000 and 2020. There are a total 67’269 publications including several different categories: 43’997 journal articles, 11’959 book chapters, 3’454 books (edited and authored), 2’014 proceedings articles, 1’671 theses, and 4’174 other items including news articles and discussion papers.\nunibas data source (research database unibas) number and type of publications exclusion criteria (year?), data selection (only faculties), not associated institutes (link to organigram figure)\nDiversity Labeling from Author First Names\nWe use information concerning diversity derived from the authors’ first names.\nWe recruit the services genderize.io, agify.io, nationalize.io to determine the authors’ probable gender, age, and nation, respectively.
