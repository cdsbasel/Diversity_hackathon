This is the home of the **CDS Diversity Hackathon** taking place Fall 2021 (HS21). 

The project is the result of a partnership between the [Diversity Office](https://www.unibas.ch/de/Universitaet/Administration-Services/Vizerektorat-People-And-Culture/Diversity-and-Inclusion/Diversity.html) and the [Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/fakultaet/abteilungen/cognitive-and-decision-sciences-305/) of the University of Basel aimed at obtaining an overview of the research output of the University of Basel. 

This project received support of the [Sustainability Office](https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/General-Secretariat/Sustainability/Team.html) of the University of Basel and was funded by IMPULS, a program of the University of Basel and U-Change: [www.unibas.ch/impuls](https://www.unibas.ch/impuls).

The project consists of a hackathon that utilizes data from the scientific outputs of Unibas researchers to map how different groups of individuals (e.g., males vs. females) contribute to research. You can find information about the [contributors](contributors.html), the [hackathon](hackathon.html), and the associated [data](data.html) in the respective pages. The results of the hackathon are available in an online [report](report.html).
