#### Data and Preprocessing

We use data from a database listing the University of Basel's research output between 2000 and 2020. 

<i>Diversity Dimensions</i>

We use information concerning diversity by categorizing author's names (e.g., gender, age, nationality). More details to follow. 

<i>Organizational Units</i>

In a previous project, CDS members identified faculty-level organizational units within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) manually, using the [descriptors](https://edoc.unibas.ch/view/divisions/) currently in use at the University of Basel. 

The data is shared via this <a href="https://github.com/cdsbasel/Diversity_hackathon"><b>Github</b></a> repository.
